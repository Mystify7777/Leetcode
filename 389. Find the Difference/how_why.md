# How & Why: LeetCode 389 - Find the Difference

---

## Problem Restatement
You are given two strings `s` and `t`:
- `t` is generated by shuffling `s` and adding one extra character at a random position.

You need to find and return the extra character.

---

## How to Solve
The trick here is to use **bitwise XOR**:
- XOR has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`.
- If we XOR all characters of both strings, every character that appears in both will cancel out, leaving only the extra character.

### Implementation
```java
public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
    int xor = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        xor ^= s.charAt(i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
        xor ^= t.charAt(i);
    }
    return (char) xor;
}
```

## Why This Works
1. **Cancellation Property**: XOR cancels identical characters, so only the unique (extra) character remains.
2. **Order Independent**: Shuffling does not matter, since XOR is commutative and associative.
3. **No Extra Memory**: We avoid hash maps or frequency arrays.

---

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` = length of `s`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant extra memory.

---

## Example Walkthrough
Input:
```
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
```

Process:
- XOR(s): a ^ b ^ c ^ d
- XOR(t): (a ^ b ^ c ^ d) ^ e
- Cancellation removes a,b,c,d → result = e

Output:
```
'e'
```

## Alternate Approaches
1. **Frequency Count (HashMap or Array)**:
   - Count characters in `s` and `t`, then compare.
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(26) for lowercase letters.

2. **Sum of ASCII Values**:
   - Sum ASCII of `t` minus sum of ASCII of `s` → difference is the extra character.
   - Similar in efficiency to XOR.

### Optimal Choice
The **XOR approach** is the cleanest:
- Simple one-pass solution.
- Constant space.
- Elegant and avoids extra structures.

---

## Key Insight
The problem exploits the **XOR cancellation property**. Since every pair of equal characters cancels out, the leftover is guaranteed to be the extra character.
